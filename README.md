# A Variation of Simon
## Old MacDonald's Farm - Simon Style

I have 6 nephews and nieces all under the age of 5.
Some are learning their animals, some are learning colors, and the oldest is obsessed with Simon.
They are the inspiration for this version of Simon.

Similar to any other Simon memory game, the player must repeat the randomly generated pattern of colors and sounds.
If the player does not repeat the pattern correctly, the game will reset and the player will be prompted to start over.
Unless the player chooses to reset the game by clicking on the reset button, the high score will be maintained and displayed.



### Technologies utilized:

 * HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 * jQuery
 * lodash

### Links:

* [Deployed project](http://joshua-lovell-project1.bitballoon.com/)
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ftcYgEGh/ga-wdi-project-1#)

### User stories that still need to be brought to life in v2.0:

  * User will not be able to manipulate the gameboard while the computer is displaying the game sequence.
  * User will notice an increase in speed of the displayed game sequence as he/she increases the number of rounds.
  * User will be able to listen to a background song being played throughout the game.
  * User will be able to toggle off the music, if desired.

### Other to do's:

  * DRY up the CSS and JavaScript
  * Attempt to make code more efficient through better naming structure and function utilization
  * Work on responsive design

### Lessons learned:

  * Gained a better understanding of when to utilize switch statements versus an if/esle statement
  * Gained more knowledge on the data structure of arrays and how best to compare two arrays against each other.

### Wireframe:

  * Since creating the Wireframe, changes were made to include a reset button in a div below the gameboard.
